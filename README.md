# Introduction to Python at SciPy 2018

Monday, July 9 at 8:00 AM

This tutorial is a gentle introduction to Python for folks who are completely
new to it and may not have much experience programming. We’ll work in a Jupyter
Notebook, one of the most popular tools in scientific Python. You’ll learn how
to write beautiful Python while practicing loops, if’s, functions, and usage of
Python’s built-in features in a series of fun, interactive exercises. By the end
of the tutorial we think you’ll be ready to write your own basic Python -- but
most importantly, we want you to learn the form and vocabulary of Python so that
you can understand Python documentation and interpret code written by others.

See the tutorial description on the conference website
[here](https://scipy2018.scipy.org/ehome/index.php?eventid=299527&tabid=711308&cid=2229599&sessionid=21546432&sessionchoice=1&).

## Setup Instructions

**Please do at least the download and install of Anaconda before coming to the tutorial!**
**We can help with further setup at the tutorial.**

If you don't already have Anaconda installed, download and install Anaconda
for **Python 3** (_not Python 2_):
https://www.anaconda.com/download.

If you're prompted to install VS Code we recommend you **do** install it
unless you already have a code editor you prefer.

After installing Anaconda you can test your installation using
[these instructions](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/test-installation.html).

If you'd like to do your own setup, we'll be using the following Python libraries:

- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
